# week19  

- wow, Kaena point!  What. A.  Ride.  Bike is strong machine.  Write this up post pics this eve.  
- leverage that success.  
- this week- ss,, 601, all pretty caught up.  Laundry, upack, shop.  Get ahead work.  
- bike steady, plan next epic.   
- get this liquid/jekyll/ghub stuff sorted!  
- 

## tues.  
- some images and mov from Kaena now uploaded to git.  
- latest plan :  make image site mostly html with minimal jekyll just to get going?  
- best idea yet:  not posts but collections, get past this jekyll block:
