- leverage that success.

- bike steady, plan next epic.   
- get this liquid/jekyll/ghub stuff sorted!

## tues.  
- some images and mov from Kaena now uploaded to git.  
- latest plan :  make image site mostly html with minimal jekyll just to get going?  
- best idea yet:  not posts but collections, get past this jekyll block:
