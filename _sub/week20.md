# Week20

## Mon 15 may - Sun 21 may.  
- new idea for weeks- append prior weeks to bottom of last week?  then becomes tall searchable in one file?  
- iPhoney seems working today???  Otherwise best buy has Oneplus nord 200, (alt nord 20), for a cnote.  
- keep iphoney plugged in tonight and check tomorrrow.  
- when able:  github nav:  check out https://just-the-docs.com/docs/navigation-structure/, has a very clean navigation setup.  
- and, better yet, it incorporates/links to mermaid diagrams:  https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/documentation-portal-publisher-guide/advanced/mermaid?id=examples
- alternatively, https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll-next-version/building-navigation.html using liquid.
