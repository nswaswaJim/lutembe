- Like every other day, is first day of the rest of my life.  
- 
Wow, what a weekend!!! Sat ride was epic.  China Walls!!!  almost 25 mile round trip.  Plus a swim and a cleaning.  Even pizza and movie.  Good day.  
Sunday- was a good day, until...wtf man?!  Mike goes to tower to pack.  Comes home, tells me about it, and that... he told Mom and Merin...
'jim might not go into lounge (that M paid for for 12 hour layouver) in Chicago.' Mike why?  Why would you tell them that?  I might like the lounge, they can ask me...
'because you're anti Europe.'  My fucking god.  
What a shitty thing to have argument about, and he adamantly defends it.  Nice thing before our trip huh?  selfish dick.  What would it possibly benefit him to have me wait outside the lounge, because, and to tell mom, 'jim is anti europe?'  Dickhead.  

Mon- getting work done.  then:
- bike.
- final touches pack.
- jekyll asmap.  

Tues- wake mid, final touch pack, loooong flight.  Charge chromey...
