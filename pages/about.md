Oh You clicked the image instead of the navigation links! Ok now you have a tangent.


Ok, this image is NOT from biking around the island.  It was an image I put on the page as a placeholder while making the site, and is just too good to take down.  

This is the evening sun setting in one of the most amazing, magical places that I know of on the entire planet.  Volcanos, high altitude lakes dotted with beautiful islands; three borders and all the culture, trade, markets that brings, all blending together at the bottom of the slopes of these incredible volcanos.  

** Ok, now the About: **  
It is amazing how something so simple like a bike can change things.
