You clicked the image instead of the link?!  Ok now you have a tangent.  Happens to me all the time...  
Muhabura- ok, this image is NOT from biking around the island.  This is the evening sun setting in one of the most amazing, magical places that I know of on the entire planet.  Volcanos, high altitude lakes dotted with beautiful islands.  Three borders, multiple languages and cultures- mostly similar but each unique- all blending together at the bottom of the slopes of these incredible volcanos.
