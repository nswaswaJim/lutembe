And this is plain text written in ReText on the bus: 
5/8/23:  should be posts:  
wow Kaena point ride!  25 miles.  Epic unintendo.  
what we did:  rode waianae, kaena point, Haleiwa; bus back.
what went right:  got a little lucky, nothing broke on me or bike.  Carried enough water, leatherman saved the day (wire), sunscreen, hat in case breakdown.  

wrong:  Not enough planning for trip home/busroute.  Not enough cash or card.  Worked, but thin margins and a little disorganized.  

learned:  Confidence in making goal.  Be ready for it.  Plan a little more on far end.  more cash/card/charge/etc.  Do epics on Saturdays.  

p1 edit: added 'myvar: testvar' to frontmatter.  link test next.
